/*


  Variables!
  - like storing a value in a box
  - variables evaluate to the value stored in the box

  Values could be:
    - string
    - numbers
    - booleans
    - arrays
    - function
*/

/*
  Variable initialization - both declaring and assignment
  variable declaration - declaring the variable
  variable assignment - assigning a value to a variable
    we use the assignment operator -> =
*/

let variableName; //variable declaration -  weve declared the variableName variable
variableName = 'hello'; //variable assignment - weve assigned the the variable, variableName the string 'hello' using the assignment operator -> =
// console.log(variableName);
variableName = 'goodbye';
// console.log(variableName);

//variable initialization
//both the process of assignment and declaration
let variableName1 = 'hello 2';
console.log(variableName1);
let name, age, town;
name = 'brandon';
