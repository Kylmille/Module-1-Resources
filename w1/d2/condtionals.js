/*
Conditionals!
Conditional statements will act as control for the flow of our apps and functions.
The basic structure of a conditional statement looks like:

if (condition or comparison){
  <run this code>
} else if (other condition or comparison) {
  <run this code>
} else {
  <do this code if none of the conditions are met>
}
Let's write a few in practice
