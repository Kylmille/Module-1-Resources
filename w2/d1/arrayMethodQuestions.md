What types of problems would require a combination of the methods we just learned (for each, map, filter, reduce)?

Is there a way to way to nest a function using these methods so we can iterate through the array backwards?

Is it possible to use multiples of these function in one function expression such as forEach and reduce?

If we wanted to reverse the array or if we wanted (i +=2 etc) , would we still use to same parks.map? (edited) 

Why can’t you use the foeEach method to reverse in array, or skip some elements in array?

Why do we not use return on the forEach() method?

Are there best practices for determining the best array method to use when solving a problem IRL? What kind of keywords or indicators should I look for within the problem question to lead me to the correct method?

Do these array methods use more memory/ which one is faster?

How would we make a second function within  one of these as the primary function?

It seems these four methods are best used when the for loop starts and the beginning, goes to the end, and goes through each integration one at a time. We think you can use .shift function to start at a different location, or .pop to end at a different location. Can you iterate through not every number (example ++2?)
Basically when do you just use a for loop instead of these methods.

Can we put a pre-declare function as the parameter function of the map or reduce or filter function?

For all these 4 new function methods we learnt, compare to the original for loops, except they are shorter and better readability, how is the computational speed? will these save time?

What kind of for loops can we NOT use array.forEach for?

What is the difference between forEach and map?














-- forEach --
If the forEach method only work for i++ or can you have different iterations?

Will forEach method create a new array?

What will happen if you were to mutate an array within the function of forEach? i.e changing the array length while iterating through it

It is said that you cannot iterate backwards using forEach(), but is there any functions that can help with reverse iteration using a forEach().

Why can’t you use the foeEach method to reverse in array, or skip some elements in array?

We were a bit unsure on how useful the For Each loop would be if it wasn’t actually returning a value.   Would we be using that much if we aren’t just using console.log?

Is there a way to iterate through the forEach backwards?

Can the forEach method create a new array?



-- Map --
When using the map method can you iterate forwards and backwards through the same array? 



-- Filter --
For the filter array method, how would it be used to filter through 2D arrays? What would be the the return values of the this filter?

Does .filter make slice() redundant on arrays?

For array.filter() in MDN the syntax has a parameter called index. We were confused about what exactly index means.



-- Reduce --
Is there a way to return anything else from reduce like a string or an object i know its meant to return just one integer but i was curious if thats possible

Can the reduce method be used on other data types within an array, such as a string, or is it only for numbers?

Is it possible to .reduce an input of multiple arrays?

Does the .reduce method only apply to numbers? or is it useable across all data types

Are there any specific limitations with the reduce method that would deem a for loop more effective?

Is .reduce a viable method for combing over 2d arrays in order to get min max values from said 2d array?

How can we use .reduce() inside a helper function to get the average of an array. especially for example the grocery question on the practice assessment.

Is the reduce method only limited to arithmetic operations?

Can you use reduce on nested arrays? If so, can you show us an example? Would you need to use a "second loop" (for example, using a second reduce)?

Can you we use the reduce method, in which we pass through a callback and initial value as its arguments, on an array with string elements to return a new array containing those string elements with vowels removed?

Why do you alway have to return accumulator in reduce() even if you’re not updating the value. why doesn’t it default to return accumulator?

Why does the number outside the curly braces become the accum when it comes after the accum value?

Are we able to pass through strings for the reduce method?
