/*

  Rest and Spread Operator!

  - The Rest operator allows us to accept any arbitary number
    of arguments inside a function

    - We know function can take fewer args than expected,
      - param will be undefined if no args is passed
    - javascript can also accept extra arguments
      - using rest
